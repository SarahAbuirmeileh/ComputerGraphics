# Table Lamp Computer Graphics 💡

## Overview
Welcome to the Table Lamp project, developed at Palestine Polytechnic University. This project provides a versatile rendering widget implemented in C++ using the Qt framework and is built using CMake. The widget is designed to facilitate the drawing of various geometric shapes, including lines, circles, ellipses, and arcs. Using these basic shapes I used them to drow a simple Lamp.

Whether you're a student exploring computer graphics or a developer seeking a lightweight graphics rendering tool, RenderWidget aims to meet your needs and goals. 🎯🔥

## Features 💻
1. Drawing Lines 📈 <br>
The Render Widget supports two efficient functions for drawing lines - the Bresenham algorithm (draw Line) implementing in two ways , providing flexibility in line rendering.

2. Drawing Circles ⚪️<br>
Efficiently draw circles using the incremental method.

3. Drawing Arcs 🌈<br>
Specify the center, start angle, end angle, and radius to draw precise arcs using the drawArc method.
 
4. Drawing Ellipses 🥚<br>
Create ellipses by specifying the center and major and minor axes with the drawEllipse method.
